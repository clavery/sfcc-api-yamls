      description: Triggers rule validation for all described descriptors. When a
        validation rule for a descriptor is triggered active alerts might be deleted
        if the conditions are not met anymore.    Additionally, new alerts might be
        created if conditions of a descriptor are now met. If the alert descriptor
        is context-specific, a context object ID needs to be provided in the request
        body.    The request body can be ued to further restrict the set of descriptors
        that are validated.
